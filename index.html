				<p>Come on, boys!
			    Ow!
			    She looks so fine like champagne or wine, no one ever gets her
			    Oh, ain't she cool, plays us for fools if we wanna let her
			    Across the room she sees some buffoon blown away by her style
			    She goes out of her way so that she can play and make him beg for a little
			    She's gonna

                And while one is healing, they go and step on another one
                Now, these people prey on us every day, some are bad, some badder
                They think we're fools, so they make their own rules, it only gets us madder</p>
